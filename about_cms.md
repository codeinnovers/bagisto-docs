## CMS ( Content Management System )

In efforts to make bagisto interactive and user friendly, we have added new feature of CMS (Content Management System) through which admin have power to create static pages content. The Pages created through CMS are in combination of channel and locale i.e., the content of page will be displayed only for channel and locale selected while creating pages.
